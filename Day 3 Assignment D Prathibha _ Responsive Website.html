		For centuries, human civilizations across the world have built and created cities, buildings, monuments, tombs, temples, churches, mosques, and other structures that continue to inspire awe in millions. Narrowing down the world's wonders to only seven is a difficult task. Luckily, the New7Wonders Foundation took the initiative to compose a list of the "new" seven wonders of the world by narrowing down a list of 200 monuments from around the world, including some of the world's most famous landmarks. 21 finalists were selected from this list, and the top seven were selected by popular vote.
